&lt;p>Whatever principles I try to live &amp;amp; work by, I try to apply them just as much &amp;amp; as often as possible. Yesterday, though, a lawn chair taught me a valuable lesson about the principle of flow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>無論我嘗試遵循什麼原則生活和工作，我都盡可能頻繁地應用這些原則。然而，昨天，一把lawn chair教會了我關於流動原則的寶貴一課。&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Principle of Flow states that, all else being equal, smaller batches of value more frequently is worth more than that same value delivered in fewer, larger batches. You’ll find the Principle of Flow working every corner of Extreme Programming—software design, planning, testing, integration, deployment, conversations—every corner.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning in the Forest</title><link>https://easylive1989.github.io/readings/backup/learning-in-the-forest/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 16:18:55 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://easylive1989.github.io/readings/backup/learning-in-the-forest/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/learning-in-the-forest?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;amp;publication_id=256838&amp;amp;post_id=151741306&amp;amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;amp;isFreemail=true&amp;amp;r=qyvh0&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;amp;utm_medium=email">Source&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How &amp;amp; why does The Forest emphasize learning over production?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>《森林》如何以及為什麼強調學習重於產出？&lt;/p>

&lt;p>以下是詳細說明，thrillfall。&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kent once visited a media tablet project that Dan Ingalls was running (pre-iPad). They were coding in Smalltalk, of course, but they had to port it to their new platform. He was telling me the story of implementing the graphics primitives. Dan had (with Diana Merry-Shapiro) invented BitBLT. Everybody on the team had implemented BitBLT on some platform. Everybody except one. So that person, of course, implemented BitBLT.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
