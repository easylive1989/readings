Where This Came From This conversation began as a consequence to David’s RailsConf keynote where he expressed his unhappiness with TDD and Unit Testing in the Rails community. He shortly followed this with some blog posts, the first of which declared that “TDD is dead”.
這段對話始於 David 在 RailsConf 的主題演講中表達了他對 Rails 社區中 TDD 和單元測試的不滿。隨後不久,他發表了一些博客文章,其中第一篇宣稱「TDD 已死」。
A couple of days after this, I sent him a typo correction to a follow-on post, and he said he’d welcome my thoughts on his talk and blog post. We then had an enjoyable and thoughtful discussion for an hour on Skype. David had a similar discussion with Kent, and Kent suggested that we continue the discussion with all three of us, and make the conversation public. David tweeted the idea and got a lot of positive reactions.

The term ‘Mock Objects’ has become a popular one to describe special case objects that mimic real objects for testing. Most language environments now have frameworks that make it easy to create mock objects. What’s often not realized, however, is that mock objects are but one form of special case test object, one that enables a different style of testing. In this article I’ll explain how mock objects work, how they encourage testing based on behavior verification, and how the community around them uses them to develop a different style of testing.

As my career has turned into full-time authorship, I often worry about distancing myself from the realities of day-to-day software development. I’ve seen other well-known figures lose contact with reality, and I fear the same fate. My greatest source of resistance to this is Thoughtworks, which acts as a regular dose of reality to keep my feet on the ground.
隨著我的職業生涯逐漸轉向全職作者,我經常擔心自己會脫離日常軟體開發的現實。我見過其他知名人物失去與現實的聯繫,而我也擔心自己會面臨同樣的命運。讓我能抵抗這種命運的最大來源是 Thoughtworks,它定期讓我保持現實感,讓我腳踏實地。
Thoughtworks also acts as a source of ideas from the field, and I enjoy writing about useful things that my colleagues have discovered and developed. Usually these are helpful ideas, that I hope that some of my readers will be able to use. My topic today isn’t such a pleasant topic. It’s a problem and one that we don’t have an answer for.

Tell-Don’t-Ask is a principle that helps people remember that object-orientation is about bundling data with the functions that operate on that data. It reminds us that rather than asking an object for data and acting on that data, we should instead tell an object what to do. This encourages to move behavior into an object to go with the data.
Tell-Don’t-Ask 是一個原則，幫助人們記住物件導向是關於將資料與操作該資料的函式捆綁在一起。它提醒我們，與其詢問物件的資料並對該資料進行操作，不如告訴物件要做什麼。這鼓勵將行為移動到與資料相關的物件中。
Let’s clarify with an example. Let’s imagine we need to monitor certain values, signaling an alarm should the value rise above a certain limit. If we write this in an “ask” style, we might have a data structure to represent these things…

Unit testing is often talked about in software development, and is a term that I’ve been familiar with during my whole time writing programs. Like most software development terminology, however, it’s very ill-defined, and I see confusion can often occur when people think that it’s more tightly defined than it actually is.
單元測試經常在軟體開發中被提及,這是我寫程式時一直熟悉的術語。然而,像大多數軟體開發術語一樣,它的定義非常模糊,我發現當人們認為它的定義比實際更為嚴謹時,往往會引起混淆。
Although I’d done plenty of unit testing before, my definitive exposure was when I started working with Kent Beck and used the Xunit family of unit testing tools. (Indeed I sometimes think a good term for this style of testing might be “xunit testing.”) Unit testing also became a signature activity of ExtremeProgramming (XP), and led quickly to TestDrivenDevelopment.

Unveiling the benefits of frequent pair rotation through an experiment 透過實驗揭示頻繁配對輪換的優勢 Benefits of pair programming are widely accepted but advice around pair rotation remains controversial. When and how frequently should teammates rotate pairs? And… What if we rotate pairs every day? We worked with three teams through an exercise of daily pair rotation. We developed a lightweight methodology to help teams reflect on the benefits and challenges of pairing and how to solve them. Initial fears were overcome and teams discovered the benefits of frequently rotating pairs. We learned that pair swapping frequently greatly enhances the benefits of pairing. Here we share the methodology we developed, our observations, and some common fears and insight shared by the participating team members.

Whatever principles I try to live & work by, I try to apply them just as much & as often as possible. Yesterday, though, a lawn chair taught me a valuable lesson about the principle of flow.
無論我嘗試遵循什麼原則生活和工作，我都盡可能頻繁地應用這些原則。然而，昨天，一把lawn chair教會了我關於流動原則的寶貴一課。
The Principle of Flow states that, all else being equal, smaller batches of value more frequently is worth more than that same value delivered in fewer, larger batches. You’ll find the Principle of Flow working every corner of Extreme Programming—software design, planning, testing, integration, deployment, conversations—every corner.

Last week, we discussed the differences between stubs and mocks. Today, we’ll talk about some general tips and advice that regard to TDD and writing tests in general.
Test-induced design damage or why TDD is so painful How to do painless TDD Integration testing or how to sleep well at nights The most important TDD rule Stubs vs Mocks TDD best practices Test-first vs code-first approach There’s some dispute about how exactly tests should be written. While the TDD process itself insists on the test-first approach, I personally think that both ways are applicable in different circumstances. Let’s look at the pros and cons of each of them.

I vividly remember one of my first sightings of a large software project. I was taking a summer internship at a large English electronics company. My manager, part of the QA group, gave me a tour of a site and we entered a huge, depressing, windowless warehouse full of people working in cubicles. I was told that these programmers had been writing code for this software for a couple of years, and while they were done programming, their separate units were now being integrated together, and they had been integrating for several months. My guide told me that nobody really knew how long it would take to finish integrating. From this I learned a common story of software projects: integrating the work of multiple developers is a long and unpredictable process.

How & why does The Forest emphasize learning over production?
《森林》如何以及為什麼強調學習重於產出？
Well here you go, thrillfall.
以下是詳細說明，thrillfall。
Kent once visited a media tablet project that Dan Ingalls was running (pre-iPad). They were coding in Smalltalk, of course, but they had to port it to their new platform. He was telling me the story of implementing the graphics primitives. Dan had (with Diana Merry-Shapiro) invented BitBLT. Everybody on the team had implemented BitBLT on some platform. Everybody except one. So that person, of course, implemented BitBLT.
