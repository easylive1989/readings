The Forest and the Desert is a metaphor for thinking about software development processes, developed by Beth Andres-Beck and hir father Kent Beck. It posits that two communities of software developers have great difficulty communicating to each other because they live in very different contexts, so advice that applies to one sounds like nonsense to the other.

《森林與沙漠》是一個用來思考軟體開發流程的隱喻，由 Beth Andres-Beck 與其父 Kent Beck 提出。這個隱喻認為，兩種軟體開發者社群之間的溝通困難重重，因為他們所處的環境截然不同，因此適用於其中一方的建議，對另一方而言往往顯得荒謬無稽。

The desert is the common world of software development, where bugs are plentiful, skill isn't cultivated, and communications with users is difficult. The forest is the world of a well-run team that uses something like [Extreme Programming](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ExtremeProgramming.html), where developers swiftly put changes into production, protected by their tests, code is invested in to keep it healthy, and there is regular contact with The Customer.

「沙漠」代表一般的軟體開發世界，這裡錯誤叢生、技術不受培養、與使用者的溝通困難重重。而「森林」則象徵一個運行良好的團隊，比如採用極限編程（Extreme Programming）的環境，開發者能夠迅速將變更部署到生產環境，並受到測試的保護，代碼也會被持續投資以保持健康，且團隊能夠定期與客戶溝通。

Clearly Beth and Kent prefer The Forest (as do I). But the metaphor is more about how description of The Forest and the advice for how to work there often sounds nonsensical to those whose only experience is The Desert. It reminds us that any lessons we draw about software development practice, or architectural patterns, are governed by the context that we experienced them. It is possible to change Desert into Forest, but it's difficult - often requiring people to do things that are both hard and counter-intuitive. (It seems sadly easier for The Forest to submit to desertification.)

顯然，Beth 和 Kent 更偏好「森林」（我也是）。但這個隱喻更重要的意義在於：對於那些只經歷過「沙漠」的人來說，「森林」的描述與工作方式往往聽起來毫無道理。我們的軟體開發實踐或架構模式所獲得的經驗教訓，都是由我們所處的環境決定的。從「沙漠」轉變為「森林」是可能的，但卻十分困難——往往需要人們做出既困難又違反直覺的改變。（可惜的是，「森林」退化為「沙漠」似乎要容易得多。）

In this framing I'm definitely a Forest Dweller, and seek with Thoughtworks to cultivate a healthy forest for us and our clients. I work to explain The Forest to Desert Dwellers, and help my fellow Forest Dwellers to make their forest even more plentiful.

在這個框架下，我毫無疑問是一名「森林居民」，並且希望與 Thoughtworks 一起培養一片健康的森林，無論是為我們自己還是客戶。我努力向「沙漠居民」解釋「森林」的概念，並幫助我的同伴讓這片森林變得更加繁茂。
