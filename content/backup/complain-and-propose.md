"Jean-Louis wants to see you in his office." My boss Eagle Burns' bald head disappeared from the door to my office. Something about his tone suggested that righteous indignation, which I had been nursing for several days, was not the right attitude to pack for my trip. I started getting scared.

「Jean-Louis 想在他的辦公室見你。」我的老闆 Eagle Burns 的光頭從我辦公室的門口消失了。他的語氣中透著某種意味，讓我覺得，這幾天我一直抱持的義憤填膺並不是此次旅程該帶上的態度。我開始感到害怕。

It was Apple 1988.

那是 1988 年的 Apple。

Jean-Louis Gassée was head of engineering. He had a reputation as a fire-eater, someone who chewed fools up and spit them out. I had been foolish, it suddenly occurred to me. Do the math.

Jean-Louis Gassée 是工程部的主管。他以敢言直行聞名，是那種會將愚蠢的人「咬碎再吐出來」的角色。我突然意識到自己確實有些愚蠢。仔細算算吧。

I was a young, cocky engineer. I was sure I knew better than anyone what needed to be done. When a decision came down that I disagreed with, I shot off an email to JLG that made it clear just how stupid the decision was. A day later, I was summoned.

我當時是一名年輕且自負的工程師，堅信自己比任何人都更知道該做些什麼。當某個我不認同的決定下來時，我立即發了一封電郵給 JLG，毫不掩飾地表達這個決定有多愚蠢。一天後，我就被召喚了。

JLG's office was on the same floor as mine, but I had never approached the sanctum. He was at least four levels up from me in hierarchy. Rumor had it that decorating his office had cost $100K, which was a fortune since everybody else was stuffed in cubes.

JLG 的辦公室和我在同一樓層，但我從未接近過那片聖地。他在層級上至少比我高四層。據說他的辦公室裝潢花了 10 萬美元，而這在當時是個天文數字，畢竟其他人都被擠在小隔間裡。

When his admin passed me in, though, JLG was avuncular. "I read your message. I'd like you to think about it from my perspective for a moment. What am I going to do if I agree with you?"

不過，當他的助理讓我進去時，JLG 卻態度溫和，「我看了你的訊息。我希望你能從我的角度想一想。如果我同意你的觀點，我該怎麼辦？」

No idea. He must have been used to dumb silence.

我完全沒有頭緒。他可能已經習慣面對這樣的沉默。

"I'm going to ask my report for a proposal. He's going to ask his report and so on yes, completely male. Plus ca change.... Eventually Eagle is going to ask you what to do. In all those layers, who knows what's going to happen to the question.

「我會問我的直屬下屬提個建議，他再問他的下屬，如此一層層下來，最終 Eagle 會來問你該怎麼辦。在這麼多層級中，誰知道問題會變成什麼樣子？

"Here's what I want you to do. Rewrite your message and make a proposal for what we should do about it. That way you'll save us a week and you'll get to solve the problem you want to solve."

「所以，我希望你這樣做。重寫你的訊息，附上一個我們可以採取的建議。這樣，你能幫我們節省一周的時間，並且能解決你想解決的問題。」

I did. I don't remember what the issue was or what I wanted to happen or what actually happened. That was lesson number one—it's really not that big a deal, or at least hardly ever.

我照做了。我已經不記得當時的問題是什麼，也不記得我希望發生什麼或實際發生了什麼。但這是第一課——這事其實沒那麼重要，至少幾乎從來不會太重要。

**always bundle a proposal with a complaint**
**抱怨時一定要附帶建議**

---

Lesson number two was to always bundle a proposal with a complaint. I've used that style daily in the intervening quarter century. If I need to vent or I need to think something through, I do it in private. If I'm going increase the scope of a communication, I always say what I would like to happen.

第二課是，抱怨時一定要附帶建議。在隨後的 25 年裡，我每天都使用這種方法。如果我需要發洩或理清思路，我會在私下進行。如果我要擴大溝通範圍，我總是說明我希望如何解決問題。

Lesson three was the most important. Those words, "Think about it from my perspective," were a revelation. You mean you have a point of view and it's just as valid as mine and it might be different? I've spent that same quarter century trying to absorb and apply that lesson. Communicating begins by putting myself in the place of my reader, not demanding that they put themself in my place.

第三課是最重要的。那句話——「從我的角度想一想」——讓我大開眼界。原來你的觀點和我的一樣有效，而且可能有所不同？在接下來的 25 年裡，我一直試圖吸收並應用這個教訓。溝通應從將自己置於讀者的立場開始，而不是要求他們站在我的立場。

**Complain _and_ propose.**
**抱怨並提出建議。**

Bonus lesson for when I was the old guy: don't get caught up in young hotshots' emotions. Assume good intentions and lack of skills. Thanks, JLG.

附加的教訓，作為後來的「老鳥」：不要被年輕氣盛的新人情緒牽著走。假設他們的出發點是好的，只是缺乏經驗。謝謝你，JLG。
