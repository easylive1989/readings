Whatever principles I try to live & work by, I try to apply them just as much & as often as possible. Yesterday, though, a lawn chair taught me a valuable lesson about the principle of flow.

無論我嘗試遵循什麼原則生活和工作，我都盡可能頻繁地應用這些原則。然而，昨天，一把lawn chair教會了我關於流動原則的寶貴一課。

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80858843-e71f-46e9-ae5e-e5b63ce43e2d_768x576.jpeg)

The Principle of Flow states that, all else being equal, smaller batches of value more frequently is worth more than that same value delivered in fewer, larger batches. You’ll find the Principle of Flow working every corner of Extreme Programming—software design, planning, testing, integration, deployment, conversations—every corner.

流動原則指出，在其他條件相同的情況下，更頻繁地傳遞較小批量的價值，比同樣的價值在較少、較大的批量中傳遞更有價值。你會發現流動原則在極限編程（Extreme Programming）的每個角落都有運作—軟體設計、規劃、測試、整合、部署、對話—每個角落。

## Lawn Chairs

Back to the lawn chairs & my obsession about principles. I was getting 2 chairs out of the box in which they shipped. First I said, “I’ll get grab one first because that will be easier.” Followed quickly by, “Hey, this is the Principle of Flow. Aren’t I a good boy to be applying my principles throughout my life? Talk about integrity!”

回到lawn chair和我對原則的執著。我正從裝運箱中取出2把椅子。一開始我說：「我先抓一把，因為那會更容易。」緊接著又說：「嘿，這就是流動原則。我不是很好地在生活中貫徹我的原則嗎？談談誠信！」

Followed by 10 minutes of thumping & swearing. Every time I moved the top chair, the bottom chair would shift. The shift deformed the cardboard box (which I couldn’t destroy), causing the top chair to be more firmly stuck. (At this point a diagram would likely help, but that seems overkill for the eventual conclusion—trust me that moving one chair caused that chair, indirectly, to be more stuck.)

接著是10分鐘的敲打和咒罵。每次我移動頂部的椅子，底部的椅子都會移位。這使紙板箱變形（我無法摧毀它），導致頂部的椅子更加卡住。（在這一點上，一個圖表可能會有幫助，但對於最終的結論來說似乎有些過度—相信我，移動一把椅子間接地導致那把椅子更加卡住。）

Principled action can be extremely expensive if you’re dumb about it.

如果你傻乎乎地這麼做，遵循原則的行動可能會變得極其昂貴。

Eventually I thought, “Well, I wonder if I can shift the bottom chair?” One tug & both chairs popped right out.

最後我想：「我想看看能不能移動底部的椅子？」一拉，兩把椅子立即彈了出來。

More obscenities. Okay, what just went on here? What was wrong with my principles or my interpretation of my principles?

更多的咒罵。好的，剛才到底發生了什麼？我的原則或對原則的解讀出了什麼問題？

## One [X] At A Time

The problem is that tricky phrase, “…all else being equal…”. In this case, 1 chair at a time wasn’t at all equal to 2 chairs at a time. 1 chair at a time caused nearly infinite friction, infinite at least from the perspective of my aching back. 2 chairs at a time had no friction, just the (light) weight of the chairs.

問題出在那個狡猾的短語，「……在其他條件相同的情況下……」。在這種情況下，一次一把椅子與一次兩把椅子完全不同。一次一把椅子造成了幾乎無限的摩擦，至少從我酸痛的背部來看是如此。兩把椅子一次則沒有摩擦，只有椅子的（輕）重量。

The bigger batch _reduced_ effort. That may be the rare case. Incentives abound to thoughtlessly increase batch size. I don’t want to make a habit of increasing batch sizes when I encounter trouble. But I need to be aware of the twin possibilities of increasing & decreasing batch size. I need to be prepared to solve for X in “One X at a time”.

更大的批量*減少*了努力。這可能是罕見的情況。增加批量的誘惑比比皆是。我不想在遇到麻煩時就不假思索地增加批量。但我需要意識到增加和減少批量的雙重可能性。我需要準備好解決「一次一件X」中的X。

(The other lesson is about hubris. Just because I have _some_ principles that seem to work in _most_ situations, I don’t have it all figured out. I need to observe, pay attention, & think.)

（另一個教訓是關於狂妄自大。僅僅因為我有一些在大多數情況下似乎有效的原則，並不意味著我已經完全弄清楚一切。我需要觀察、專注並思考。）
