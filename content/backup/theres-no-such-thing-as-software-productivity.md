[Bill Caputo](https://twitter.com/logosity), through repeated conversations we've had, has convinced me of something very surprising. It was something that changed the way I think about the world, and how I do my job.

[比爾·卡普托](https://twitter.com/logosity) 通過我們多次的對話，讓我相信了一件非常令人驚訝的事情。這件事情改變了我看待世界的方式，也改變了我工作的方式。

**There is no such thing as software productivity.**

**軟體生產力根本不存在。**

[As Martin Fowler observed](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CannotMeasureProductivity.html) almost a decade ago, productivity in software cannot be usefully measured. The reason why is it just doesn't exist in The Realm of Relevant Things. Put another way, productivity has no applicability as a metric in software. "How much did we create today?" is not a relevant question to ask. Even if it could be measured, productivity in software does not approximate business value in any meaningful way.

[正如 Martin Fowler](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CannotMeasureProductivity.html)([[Cannot Measure Productivity]])將近十年前所指出的，軟體生產力無法有效地被衡量。原因是，它在「相關的範疇」中根本不存在。換句話說，生產力在軟體中並不是一個適用的指標。「我們今天創造了多少東西？」這樣的問題並不相關。即使可以衡量，軟體中的生產力也無法以任何有意義的方式與商業價值相對應。

This is because software development is not an activity that necessarily _produces_ anything. Here's a thought experiment: Let's say that you have a couple of developers working on the same project, and by accident, both of them pick up the same task on the same day. The first one, Frank, hauls off and writes a 1000 line framework that solves the problem beautifully. The code is well written, well tested, and the deployment and operation of it is well documented. The second developer, Peter, heads off to to the park for the day, where he thinks about the problem while he feeds the pigeons. Around 4:45, Peter wanders back to the office, deletes 100 lines of code, deploys the change...and the problem is fixed.

這是因為軟體開發並不一定是一種會**產生**任何東西的活動。這裡有一個思考實驗：假設你有兩位開發者在同一個專案上工作，巧合的是，他們在同一天接手了同樣的任務。第一位開發者，Frank，花了一整天撰寫了一個 1000 行的框架，完美地解決了問題。這段程式碼編寫得很好，測試充分，部署與操作文件也非常完善。而第二位開發者，Peter，則選擇去公園待了一天，一邊餵鴿子一邊思考問題。大約在下午 4:45，Peter 回到辦公室，刪除了 100 行程式碼，部署了改動……問題就解決了。

Which of these two developers was more "productive" today? The answer is: It doesn't matter. What matters the that Peter solved the problem, while simultaneously reducing long term maintenance costs for the team. Frank also solved the problem, but he increased maintenance costs by _producing_ code, and so (all other things being equal) his solution is inferior. To call Peter more "productive" is to torture the metaphor beyond any possible point of utility.

今天這兩位開發者誰更「有生產力」？答案是：這並不重要。重要的是，Peter 解決了問題，並同時降低了團隊的長期維護成本。而 Frank 雖然也解決了問題，但因為**產生**了程式碼，增加了維護成本，因此（如果其他條件相同）他的解決方案是次優的。如果稱 Peter 更「有生產力」，那就是過度扭曲這個比喻，失去了任何實際的意義。

I would argue that what good software developers do is **remove problems**. The opposite, in fact, of production. The creation of technological artifacts such as code, documentation, data, etc...are all necessary evils to achieve the goal of removing problems. That's why, sometimes, the most effective solution to a problem is a 5 minute conversation.

我認為，優秀的軟體開發者的工作是**移除問題**。事實上，這與「生產」恰好相反。程式碼、文件、數據等技術產物的創建，只是為了實現解決問題這個目標所需的「必要之惡」。因此，有時候，解決問題最有效的方法可能就是一場 5 分鐘的對話。
